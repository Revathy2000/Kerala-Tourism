                <h2>TRIVANDRUM</h2>
                <P class="des1">Trivandrum (official name Thiruvananthapuram), lying on the southwest coast of India, is
                    the capital
                    to the state of Kerala.
                    The place is well connected to most of the other major cities of India through rail, road, and air
                    network. Because of its proximity to the sea,
                    the climate of Trivandrum is tropical.<br>
                    A gracious and evergreen city spread over seven hills, Thiruvananthapuram, capital of Kerala, is
                    steeped in history and culture.
                    Located in the extreme south of the state, its shores are washed by the warm waters of the Arabian
                    Sea. This is a city where time moves
                    gracefully with the day unfolding according to time honoured rhythms, qualities which make it one of
                    the best cities in the country.
                    Holding fort in the heart of the capital is Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple which is dedicated to Lord
                    Vishnu who reclines on the serpent Anantha
                    and after whom the city is named. Formerly called Trivandrum, the cityâ€™s original name was restored
                    in 1991.
